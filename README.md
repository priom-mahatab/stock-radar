# AI Market Radar 

A daily AI-powered stock discovery system that runs after market close and recommends stocks and ETFs worth researching. Built to learn about markets, practice machine learning engineering, and surface opportunities — not to automate trading.

---

## What It Does

Every day after the market closes, AI Market Radar:

- Analyzes the S&P 100 stock universe
- Computes price, volume, sector, and sentiment features
- Ranks stocks using a machine learning model
- Outputs a daily report with the top 5 stocks and 2 ETFs to research

### Example Output

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/priom-mahatab/stock-radar.git
cd stock-radar
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:

```
NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_here
FINNHUB_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 5. Run the pipeline

```bash
python pipeline/daily_runner.py
```

## Key Design Decisions

**Cache layer:** All market data is cached as CSV files locally. The cache is invalidated after 4:30 PM ET each trading day, ensuring the pipeline always uses the most recent closing data without redundant API calls.

**No circular dependencies:** The cache module never fetches data. The fetcher never caches. Each module has a single responsibility.

**Time-series cross-validation:** The ML model is trained using a time-based train/test split, never a random split, to prevent data leakage from future prices into training.

**Explainable outputs:** Every recommendation includes human-readable reasons derived directly from the features that drove the model's score.
